## Our way of working

- We embrace a strict no-asshole policy. We seek to collaborate with individuals who are honest, vulnerable, and genuine. Throughout our partnership, there will be ups and downs, prosperous times and challenging moments. Our belief is that navigating these circumstances together can only be achieved through honesty—expressing your true feelings and thoughts. We won't sugarcoat things. Only then can we elevate each other.
- We invest in companies where we can add value with our expertise. This can span various areas, such as general management, technology, HR, finance, and legal. By keeping some distance from day-to-day operations, we often provide a reflective perspective.
- If you can't share, you can't multiply. We believe in strong management with "skin in the game." There should be room for new employees who share in the company's success through equity.
- We embrace opportunistic entrepreneurship as our guiding principle. Realism naturally follows. It's about a "can do" attitude rather than "yes, but."

We are Yvo, Frank, Willem, Vincent, and Jaap. We have come together based on these principles. We have known each other for a long time, both personally and professionally. We have experienced success and setbacks, and we love life. Through our venture, we share money, success, and failures. It's often enjoyable, sometimes challenging—this is the life we cherish.
